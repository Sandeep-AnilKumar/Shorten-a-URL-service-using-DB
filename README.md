# Shorten-a-URL-service-using-DB

##Description

This is an update to my previous repository 'Shorten a URL service'. I have used MySQL DB for accessing and inserting URL's.
Please run the dump file in the MySQL Workbench and remove the sql file from the home directory, before importing the project into Eclipse IDE.

Please feel free to contact me in case of any doubts.

#Thanks ! :)
